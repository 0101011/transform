It accepts and returns a dictionary of tensors, where a tensor means a [`Tensor`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor) or [`SparseTensor`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/SparseTensor). There are two main groups of API calls that typically form the heart of a preprocessing function:\n",

These add TensorFlow operations to the graph that transforms raw data into transformed data one feature vector at a time.  These will run for every example, during both training and serving.\n",
        "2. **TensorFlow Transform Analyzers:** Any of the analyzers provided by tf.Transform. Analyzers also accept and return tensors, but unlike TensorFlow ops they only run once, during training, and typically make a full pass over the entire training dataset. They create [tensor constants](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/constant), which are added to your graph. For example, `tft.min` computes the minimum of a tensor over the training dataset. tf.Transform provides a fixed set of analyzers, but this will be extended in future versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** When you apply your preprocessing function to serving inferences, the constants that were created by analyzers during training do not change.  If your data has trend or seasonality components, plan accordingly."
